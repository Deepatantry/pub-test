# Component Design Plan - PremiumCard Loyalty Program

## Overview
This plan outlines the approach to create High Level Design (HLD) for each software unit identified in the inception phase. The HLD will focus on strategic components and their interactions without diving into implementation details.

## Analysis of Existing Units
Based on the units in `/workdir/inception/units/`, we have:
1. **Core Member Management** - Member lifecycle and tier management
2. **Transaction & Points Engine** - Transaction processing and point calculation
3. **Rewards & Redemption** - Category management and redemption services
4. **Analytics & Engagement** - Insights, reporting, and customer engagement

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Preparation and Analysis
- [x] **Step 1**: Analyze all unit files to understand user stories and requirements
- [x] **Step 2**: Create workdir/construction/ directory structure
- [x] **Step 3**: Identify cross-unit integration patterns and dependencies
- [x] **Step 4**: Define architectural principles and design standards

### Phase 2: High Level Design Creation
- [x] **Step 5**: Design Core Member Management Unit HLD
  - Focus on member lifecycle, tier progression, and profile management components
- [x] **Step 6**: Design Transaction & Points Engine Unit HLD
  - Focus on transaction processing, point calculation, and balance management components
- [x] **Step 7**: Design Rewards & Redemption Unit HLD
  - Focus on category management, redemption catalog, and processing components
- [x] **Step 8**: Design Analytics & Engagement Unit HLD
  - Focus on analytics engine, reporting, and notification components

### Phase 3: Integration and Validation
- [ ] **Step 9**: Design inter-unit communication patterns
  - Define event schemas, API contracts, and data flow patterns
- [ ] **Step 10**: Create system-wide integration architecture
  - Show how all units work together at high level
- [ ] **Step 11**: Validate designs against user stories and business requirements
- [ ] **Step 12**: Review and refine all HLD documents

## Design Principles

### Architectural Approach
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous communication between units
- **API-First Design**: Synchronous communication for real-time queries
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear bounded contexts for each unit
- **Scalability**: Components designed for horizontal scaling

### Component Categories
- **Controllers**: Handle external requests and orchestrate workflows
- **Services**: Implement business logic and rules
- **Repositories**: Manage data persistence and retrieval
- **Event Handlers**: Process asynchronous events from other units
- **Integrations**: Handle external system communications

## Clarifications Resolved
- **Architectural Pattern**: Microservices (confirmed)
- **Technology Stack**: Python/FastAPI (confirmed)
- **Deployment Model**: Cloud-native (confirmed)
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL + Redis (confirmed)

## Technical Specifications
- **Architecture**: Microservices with Python/FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent data, Redis for caching
- **Communication**: Event-driven (async) + REST APIs (sync)
- **Deployment**: Cloud-native containers (Docker/Kubernetes)
- **Each microservice**: Independently deployable with own database schema
- **Development**: In-memory implementations for initial development

## Deliverables
1. `/workdir/construction/core_member_management/hld.md`
2. `/workdir/construction/transaction_points_engine/hld.md`
3. `/workdir/construction/rewards_redemption/hld.md`
4. `/workdir/construction/analytics_engagement/hld.md`
5. `/workdir/construction/system_integration_architecture.md`

## Success Criteria
- Clear component boundaries and responsibilities
- Well-defined integration patterns between units
- Scalable and maintainable architecture
- Alignment with user stories and business requirements
- Foundation for detailed low-level design phase
