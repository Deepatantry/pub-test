# Rewards & Redemption - Low Level Design Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the approach to create a detailed Low Level Design (LLD) for the Rewards & Redemption microservice based on the existing High Level Design. The LLD will include tactical components, data models, and communication contracts.

## Analysis of HLD Requirements
Based on the HLD, the Rewards & Redemption unit includes:
- **5 Strategic Components**: Category Management, Spending Insights, Redemption Catalog, Redemption Processing, Value Optimization
- **8 PostgreSQL Tables**: Categories, multipliers, analytics, catalog, inventory, transactions, configs, calculations
- **4 Redis Caches**: Categories, catalog, insights, rates
- **8 REST APIs**: Category and redemption management endpoints
- **4 Event Subscriptions**: Transaction and member events
- **5 Event Publications**: Category and redemption events

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Data Model Design
- [ ] **Step 1**: Design detailed PostgreSQL database schema with relationships
- [ ] **Step 2**: Define Redis cache data structures and TTL policies
- [ ] **Step 3**: Create in-memory repository interfaces and implementations
- [ ] **Step 4**: Design event store schema for audit trails and replay
  - *Note: Need confirmation on event retention policies and replay requirements*

### Phase 2: Communication Contracts
- [ ] **Step 5**: Define inbound API request/response models with validation rules
- [ ] **Step 6**: Design outbound API client interfaces for external integrations
- [ ] **Step 7**: Specify event schemas for subscriptions and publications
- [ ] **Step 8**: Create error handling and response standardization contracts

### Phase 3: Component Implementation Design
- [ ] **Step 9**: Design Category Management Service with business rules engine
- [ ] **Step 10**: Design Spending Insights Engine with analytics algorithms
- [ ] **Step 11**: Design Redemption Catalog Service with inventory management
- [ ] **Step 12**: Design Redemption Processing Engine with workflow orchestration
- [ ] **Step 13**: Design Value Optimization Service with recommendation algorithms

### Phase 4: Integration and Configuration
- [ ] **Step 14**: Design configuration management for external dependencies
- [ ] **Step 15**: Create mock implementations for external services
- [ ] **Step 16**: Design dependency injection and service registration
- [ ] **Step 17**: Specify logging, monitoring, and health check implementations

### Phase 5: Validation and Documentation
- [ ] **Step 18**: Validate LLD against HLD requirements and user stories
- [ ] **Step 19**: Create component interaction diagrams and sequence flows
- [ ] **Step 20**: Document deployment and configuration requirements

## Design Principles

### Data Model Principles
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Aggregate roots and bounded contexts
- **Event Sourcing**: Immutable event logs for audit and replay
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read and write models for performance
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access with in-memory implementations

### API Design Principles
- **RESTful Design**: Resource-based URLs with HTTP verbs
- **Pydantic Models**: Strong typing and automatic validation
- **OpenAPI Specification**: Auto-generated documentation
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized error responses

### Event-Driven Principles
- **Event Schemas**: Versioned event contracts with backward compatibility
- **Idempotency**: Safe event replay and duplicate handling
- **Eventual Consistency**: Asynchronous processing patterns
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Failed event handling and retry mechanisms

## Clarifications Needed
- **Step 4**: What are the event retention policies? How long should events be stored for replay?
- **External Dependencies**: Which external partners need mock implementations (travel, merchandise providers)?
- **Configuration Strategy**: Preference for configuration files vs environment variables vs database config?
- **Caching Strategy**: Should Redis cache have write-through, write-behind, or cache-aside patterns?

## Assumptions
- **In-Memory Repositories**: All data access through repository pattern with in-memory implementations
- **Mock External Services**: All external dependencies will be mocked and configurable
- **Event Store**: Simple in-memory event store for development and testing
- **Configuration**: Environment variables for service configuration
- **Python/FastAPI**: Implementation using FastAPI framework with Pydantic models

## Technical Specifications
- **Framework**: FastAPI with async/await support
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy models for PostgreSQL schema
- **Caching**: Redis-py for cache operations
- **Events**: Custom event bus implementation for in-memory messaging
- **Testing**: Pytest with async test support

## Deliverables
1. **Complete LLD Document**: `/workdir/construction/rewards_redemption/lld.md`
2. **Database Schema**: Detailed table definitions with relationships
3. **API Contracts**: Request/response models with validation rules
4. **Event Schemas**: Event definitions with versioning strategy
5. **Component Specifications**: Detailed service implementations
6. **Configuration Templates**: Environment and deployment configurations

## Success Criteria
- **Complete Data Model**: All entities, relationships, and constraints defined
- **API Contracts**: All endpoints with request/response specifications
- **Event Definitions**: All inbound and outbound events specified
- **Component Design**: All services with clear responsibilities and interfaces
- **Integration Patterns**: Clear external dependency and mock strategies
- **Implementation Ready**: Sufficient detail for development team to begin coding
