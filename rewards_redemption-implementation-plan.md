## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- [x] **Step 1**: Create project structure and base configuration
  - Create directory structure under `workdir/src/rewards_redemption/`
  - Set up basic FastAPI application with CORS
  - Create configuration management with environment variables

- [x] **Step 2**: Define core data models using Pydantic
  - Category, CategoryMultiplier, SpendingAnalytics models
  - RedemptionCatalog, RedemptionInventory, RedemptionTransaction models
  - Event schemas for inbound/outbound events
  - API request/response models

- [x] **Step 3**: Implement in-memory repositories
  - Base repository interface with CRUD operations
  - Category repository with multiplier management
  - Redemption repository with catalog and transaction handling
  - Analytics repository for spending insights
  - *Note: Need confirmation on data persistence strategy for demo*

### Phase 2: Core Services Implementation
- [x] **Step 4**: Implement Category Management Service
  - CRUD operations for bonus categories
  - Multiplier configuration and seasonal updates
  - Category validation and business rules
  - Cache integration for active categories

- [x] **Step 5**: Implement Spending Insights Engine
  - Category-wise spending calculation algorithms
  - Trend analysis and recommendation logic
  - Spending cap tracking and alerts
  - Pre-calculated insights caching

- [x] **Step 6**: Implement Redemption Catalog Service
  - Catalog management with inventory tracking
  - Tier-based redemption filtering
  - Availability validation and stock management
  - Dynamic pricing and promotional rates

- [x] **Step 7**: Implement Redemption Processing Engine
  - Manual redemption workflow with validation
  - Automatic cashback processing logic
  - Point balance verification and deduction
  - Redemption confirmation and tracking

- [x] **Step 8**: Implement Value Optimization Service
  - Point-to-dollar value calculations
  - Best value recommendation algorithms
  - Personalized suggestions based on spending patterns
  - Promotional bonus tracking

### Phase 3: Event System and Integration
- [x] **Step 9**: Create event bus and handling system
  - In-memory event bus for publish/subscribe
  - Event serialization and deserialization
  - Dead letter queue simulation for failed events
  - Event replay capability for testing

- [x] **Step 10**: Implement event handlers for inbound events
  - TransactionProcessedEvent handler for spending insights
  - PointsEarnedEvent handler for balance updates
  - TierAdvancedEvent handler for redemption eligibility
  - BalanceUpdatedEvent handler for auto-redemption triggers

- [x] **Step 11**: Implement event publishers for outbound events
  - CategoryUpdatedEvent when categories change
  - RedemptionProcessedEvent after successful redemptions
  - AutoRedemptionTriggeredEvent for automatic cashbacks
  - SpendingInsightGeneratedEvent for new analytics

### Phase 4: API Layer and External Mocks
- [x] **Step 12**: Implement REST API endpoints
  - Category endpoints (GET /categories/active, insights)
  - Redemption endpoints (catalog, manual processing, history)
  - Configuration endpoints (auto-redemption settings)
  - Value analysis endpoints (comparison, recommendations)

- [x] **Step 13**: Create mock external services
  - Mock travel partner API for travel redemptions
  - Mock merchandise provider for physical rewards
  - Mock payment system for cashback processing
  - Mock notification service for confirmations
  - *Note: Need confirmation on which external partners to mock*

- [x] **Step 14**: Implement error handling and validation
  - Global exception handlers for API errors
  - Input validation using Pydantic models
  - Business rule validation with custom exceptions
  - Logging and monitoring integration points

### Phase 5: Demo Interface and Testing
- [x] **Step 15**: Create demo data seeding
  - Sample categories with multipliers and caps
  - Mock redemption catalog with various options
  - Sample member data with different tiers
  - Historical transaction data for insights

- [x] **Step 16**: Implement demo script (Python CLI
  - Interactive menu for testing all features
  - Category management operations
  - Redemption processing workflows
  - Event simulation and handling
  - *Note: Should this be CLI-based or web-based interface?*

- [x] **Step 17**: Create HTML-based demo UI
  - Simple web interface using FastAPI templates
  - Category viewing and insights dashboard
  - Redemption catalog browsing and processing
  - Auto-redemption configuration panel
  - Real-time event log display

- [x] **Step 18**: Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
  - Structured logging for all operations
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Business metrics tracking (redemption rates, etc.)
  - Health check endpoints for service status

### Phase 6: Integration and Validation
- [x] **Step 19**: Implement integration tests
  - End-to-end workflow testing
  - Event handling validation
  - API contract verification
  - Mock service integration testing

- [x] **Step 20**: Create deployment and run scripts
  - Docker configuration for containerized deployment
  - Environment setup scripts
  - Database initialization (in-memory setup)
  - Service startup and health verification
  - *Note: Need confirmation on deployment target (local only vs containerized)*

## Technical Decisions Requiring Confirmation

### Data Persistence Strategy
- **Question**: Should the in-memory repositories persist data between restarts using JSON files or remain purely in-memory?
- **Impact**: Affects demo experience and data continuity
- **Recommendation**: JSON file persistence for better demo experience

### Demo Interface Preference
- **Question**: Primary demo interface - CLI script, web UI, or both?
- **Impact**: Development effort and user experience
- **Recommendation**: Both - CLI for technical validation, web UI for business demonstration

### External Service Mocking Level
- **Question**: How detailed should external service mocks be (simple stubs vs realistic behavior)?
- **Impact**: Implementation complexity and demo realism
- **Recommendation**: Realistic behavior with configurable delays and failure scenarios

### Event Processing Strategy
- **Question**: Should events be processed synchronously or with simulated async behavior?
- **Impact**: System behavior and testing complexity
- **Recommendation**: Simulated async with configurable processing delays

### Configuration Management
- **Question**: Configuration via environment variables, JSON files, or database?
- **Impact**: Deployment flexibility and demo setup
- **Recommendation**: Environment variables with JSON file fallback

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 5 strategic components implemented and functional
- [ ] Complete API coverage for all 8 REST endpoints
- [ ] Event handling for all 4 inbound and 5 outbound events
- [ ] Working demo interface (CLI and/or web-based)
- [ ] Mock external services with realistic behavior
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and error handling
- [ ] Documentation for running and testing the system

## Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1-2**: 2-3 days (Foundation and Core Services)
- **Phase 3-4**: 2-3 days (Events and APIs)
- **Phase 5-6**: 2-3 days (Demo and Integration)
- **Total**: 6-9 days for complete implementation

## Dependencies and Assumptions
- **Python 3.8+** with FastAPI, Pydantic, and Uvicorn
- **In-memory storage** for all repositories and caches
- **Mock external services** with configurable behavior
- **Local development environment** for demo execution
- **No real database or message broker** required

---

**Next Steps**: Please review this implementation plan and provide:
1. Confirmation on technical decisions marked with "Note"
2. Approval to proceed with the implementation
3. Any additional requirements or constraints
4. Preferred demo interface type (CLI, web, or both)

Once approved, I will execute this plan step by step, marking each checkbox as completed.
