# Units of Work (UoW) Plan - PremiumCard Loyalty & Rewards Program

## Overview
This plan outlines the approach to group the 21 user stories into independent, loosely coupled units that can be built by separate teams while maintaining high cohesion within each unit.

## Analysis Approach
Based on domain-driven design principles and functional cohesion, I will group user stories by:
- **Business capability boundaries**
- **Data ownership and lifecycle**
- **Team autonomy and independence**
- **Minimal cross-unit dependencies**

## Proposed Unit Structure
After analyzing the user stories and considering a single team of 2-3 junior developers, I propose **4 sequential development units**:

1. **Core Member Management** - Account lifecycle and tier management
2. **Transaction & Points Engine** - Transaction processing and point calculation
3. **Rewards & Redemption** - Category management and redemption services
4. **Analytics & Engagement** - Insights, reporting, and notifications

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Analysis and Validation
- [x] **Step 1**: Analyze user story dependencies and data flows
- [x] **Step 2**: Create workdir/inception/units/ directory structure
- [ ] **Step 3**: Validate unit boundaries for loose coupling
  - *Note: Need confirmation on whether Analytics & Engagement should be split into separate units*

### Phase 2: Unit Definition
- [x] **Step 4**: Create Core Member Management Unit (US-001, US-002, US-003, US-010, US-011, US-012)
- [x] **Step 5**: Create Transaction & Points Engine Unit (US-004, US-005, US-006, US-007)
- [x] **Step 6**: Create Rewards & Redemption Unit (US-008, US-009, US-013, US-014, US-015)
- [x] **Step 7**: Create Analytics & Engagement Unit (US-016, US-017, US-018, US-019, US-020, US-021)

### Phase 3: Documentation and Review
- [ ] **Step 8**: Document inter-unit dependencies and integration points
- [ ] **Step 9**: Create unit responsibility matrix and development sequence
- [ ] **Step 10**: Validate each unit can be built sequentially by the junior team

## Unit Rationale

### Unit 1: Core Member Management (Development Phase 1)
**User Stories**: US-001, US-002, US-003, US-010, US-011, US-012
**Cohesion**: Complete member lifecycle from enrollment to tier progression
**Scope**: Member enrollment, profile management, tier status, tier advancement, tier benefits
**Dependencies**: None - foundational unit
**Development Time**: 4-6 weeks

### Unit 2: Transaction & Points Engine (Development Phase 2)
**User Stories**: US-004, US-005, US-006, US-007
**Cohesion**: Complete transaction processing and point calculation pipeline
**Scope**: Transaction capture, history, point calculation, category multipliers, balance tracking
**Dependencies**: Requires Unit 1 for member data
**Development Time**: 4-6 weeks

### Unit 3: Rewards & Redemption (Development Phase 3)
**User Stories**: US-008, US-009, US-013, US-014, US-015
**Cohesion**: Complete rewards and redemption management
**Scope**: Category management, spending insights, manual/automatic redemption, value optimization
**Dependencies**: Requires Unit 2 for point balances and transaction data
**Development Time**: 4-5 weeks

### Unit 4: Analytics & Engagement (Development Phase 4)
**User Stories**: US-016, US-017, US-018, US-019, US-020, US-021
**Cohesion**: Complete analytics and customer engagement platform
**Scope**: Spending insights, recommendations, reporting, notifications, milestone tracking
**Dependencies**: Requires data from all previous units
**Development Time**: 5-6 weeks

## Clarifications Resolved
- **Step 3**: Analytics and Engagement are separate units (confirmed)
- **Integration Strategy**: Both event-driven and API-based integration depending on use case
- **Data Sharing**: Shared database with clear ownership boundaries

## Development Strategy
- **Sequential Development**: One team of 2-3 junior developers builds units in order
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each unit provides working functionality before moving to next
- **Learning Progression**: Complexity increases gradually as team gains experience
- **Foundation First**: Core functionality established before advanced features

## Assumptions
- Single team of 2-3 junior developers working sequentially
- Each unit builds upon previous units' functionality
- 4-6 week development cycles per unit
- Units can be deployed incrementally
- Total development time: 17-23 weeks
